This kind of intelligence is a trait more of the character than of the brain.\n","Page 1: This page introduces the concept of intelligent investing and how it differs from traditional investing. It also discusses the importance of emotional discipline and how it can help you become a better investor.\n","Page 2: This page provides a chronicle of the financial calamities of the past few years, including the dot-com bubble, the subprime mortgage crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. It also discusses how these events could have been avoided by investors who followed Graham's principles.\n","Page 3: This page discusses the dangers of investing in technology and Internet stocks, and how these investments are often not as profitable as they seem. It also provides examples of investors who lost money by investing in these types of stocks.\n","In the introduction of the book, Graham explains the difference between investment and speculation. He argues that an investment is an operation that promises safety of principal and an adequate return, while speculation is an operation that does not meet these requirements. He also points out that the term \"investor\" has been misused in recent years to refer to anyone who buys or sells a security, regardless of whether they are doing so for investment or speculation purposes.\n","\n","In Chapter 1, Graham discusses the concept of appropriate portfolio policy for the individual, nonprofessional investor. He argues that the intelligent investor should focus on long-term investing and should avoid speculating in individual stocks. He also emphasizes the importance of diversification and of having a margin of safety in one's investments.\n","In this chapter, the author discusses the difference between investment and speculation, and how speculation can be both beneficial and dangerous. He also provides advice on how to manage your risk when speculating. Finally, he discusses the expected return for defensive investors and how it has changed over time.\n","In 1964, Graham recommended a 50/50 stock/bond portfolio, with the stock component tilted towards companies with a good inflation hedge.\n","Since 1964, interest rates on bonds have risen significantly, while dividend yields on stocks have remained relatively flat. As a result, bonds are now a more attractive investment than stocks.\n","In late 1971 and early 1972, the DJIA was trading at 900, yielding 3.5%. High-grade bonds were yielding 8% taxable and 5.7% tax-free.\n","On a before-tax basis, the combined return of stocks would average 7.5%, somewhat less than the interest on high-grade bonds. On an after-tax basis, the average return on stocks would work out at some 5.3%.\n","This would be about the same as is now obtainable on good tax-free medium-term bonds.\n","Graham concludes that bonds are now a more attractive investment than stocks.\n","The author argues that, given the current yield relationship between bonds and stocks, bond investment appears clearly preferable to stock investment. However, he acknowledges that there are other factors to consider, such as the possibility of an accelerating inflation, which would make stock equities preferable to bonds.\n","He then reiterates his basic compromise policy for defensive investors, which is to have a significant part of their funds in bond-type holdings and a significant part also in equities. He also discusses the common-stock portfolio of the defensive investor, and argues that the overall results are not likely to be decisively different from one diversified or representative list than from another.\n","Finally, he warns investors that they cannot hope for better than average results by buying new offerings, or “hot” issues of any sort, and that the defensive investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition.\n","None\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses the difficulty of finding undervalued stocks and the diminishing profitability of special situations. He provides three examples of such situations: (1) buying a stock that is selling below its intrinsic value, (2) buying a stock that is about to be acquired in a merger, and (3) buying a stock that is selling below its working capital. He concludes that these opportunities are no longer as common as they once were, but that there are still ways for enterprising investors to achieve better-than-average results.\n","Chapter 1 of the book \"The Intelligent Investor\" by Benjamin Graham discusses the difference between investing and speculating. Graham defines investing as \"an investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return\". He contrasts this with speculation, which he defines as \"gambling that a stock will go up in price because somebody else will pay even more for it\".\n","\n","Graham argues that speculating is a losing proposition in the long run, as the odds are stacked against the speculator. He urges investors to focus on safety and adequate returns, and to avoid the temptation to speculate.\n","\n","He also warns against the dangers of trading too frequently, and encourages investors to hold their stocks for the long term.\n","The stock market became a nonstop national video game.\n","People felt more knowledgeable about the markets than ever before,\n","but knowledge was nowhere to be found. Stocks became entirely\n","decoupled from the companies that had issued them—pure abstractions,\n","just blips moving across a TV or computer screen. If the blips were\n","moving up, nothing else mattered.\n","The text describes the different speculative formulas that have been promoted in the last decade, such as the January effect or the \"what works on Wall Street\" formula. All of them shared some traits, such as being quick and easy, and violated at least one of Graham's distinctions between investing and speculating. The text also highlights that these formulas have not worked in the long term.\n","None\n","Chapter 2: The Investor and Inflation\n","In this chapter, we will discuss the effect of inflation on investments and how investors can protect themselves from its negative effects.\n","We will start by looking at the historical record of inflation in the United States. We will then discuss the different ways that inflation can affect investments, and how investors can use various strategies to protect themselves from its negative effects.\n","Finally, we will provide some concluding thoughts on the topic of inflation and investing.\n","The chapter discusses the effect of inflation on investments. It argues that there is no strong connection between inflation and the performance of stocks. In fact, the author believes that stocks are not a good hedge against inflation. He concludes that investors should focus on the long-term growth of their investments and not worry about inflation.\n","The chapter discusses the effect of inflation on common stocks and other investments. It concludes that common stocks are not a good inflation hedge and that investors should instead focus on assets that provide a high current yield, such as bonds and preferred stocks.\n","This chapter discusses alternative investments to stocks and bonds, such as precious metals and real estate. The author concludes that the best way to hedge against inflation is to hold a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.\n","Page 1:\n","- Investors often overlook the importance of inflation because of the money illusion.\n","- Inflation can destroy wealth and is a risk that investors should be aware of.\n","- The US has experienced periods of high inflation in the past and it is possible that it could happen again.\n","- Rising prices allow governments to pay off their debts more easily.\n","\n","Page 2:\n","- Stocks are often seen as a hedge against inflation, but this is not always the case.\n","- In years when inflation is high, stocks can also perform poorly.\n","- Stocks have outperformed inflation over the long term, but they have not always done so.\n","\n","The two pages are connected by the discussion of inflation and its effects on stocks.\n","Stocks do not always hedge against inflation. When inflation is high, stocks can lose value. However, there are two investments that can help protect against inflation: REITs and TIPS. REITs are real estate investment trusts that own and collect rent from commercial and residential properties. TIPS are U.S. government bonds that automatically go up in value when inflation rises. Both REITs and TIPS are best suited for a tax-deferred retirement account like an IRA, Keogh, or 401(k).\n","Chapter 3 presents a century of stock market history, starting in 1871. It shows the major fluctuations in the price level and the varying relationships between stock prices, earnings, and dividends.\n","\n","Two tables and a chart are used to summarize the long-term history of the stock market. The first table shows the low and high points of nineteen bear- and bull-market cycles in the past 100 years. The second table shows the average level of stock prices, earnings, and dividends for each decade.\n","\n","The chart depicts the market fluctuations of Standard & Poor's 425-industrial-stock index from 1900 to 1970. It shows three distinct patterns, each covering about a third of the 70 years.\n","\n","The first period runs from 1900 to 1924, and shows for the most part a series of rather similar market cycles lasting from three to five years. The annual advance in this period averaged just about 3%.\n","\n","The second period is from 1924 to 1949, and shows the “New Era” bull market, culminating in 1929, with its terrible aftermath of collapse. The annual rate of advance to be a mere 1\n","1⁄2%.\n","\n","The third period is from 1949 to 1968, and shows the greatest bull market in our history. The advance was more than sixfold in 17 years—which is at the average compounded rate of 11% per year, not counting dividends of, say, 3\n","1⁄2% per annum.\n","The stock market has seen a great deal of growth over the past century, with the S&P composite index rising from 10 to 125 between 1900 and 1970. However, the rate of growth has varied significantly from decade to decade. The 1950s saw the most pronounced growth, with the index more than doubling, while the 1960s saw a more modest increase. The 1970s saw a decline in the index, with the market falling by 36% from its 1968 high.\n","\n","The table below provides a more detailed look at the performance of the stock market over the past century. It shows that earnings and dividends have generally increased over time, although there have been some periods of decline. The price-earnings ratio has also fluctuated significantly, reaching a high of 22.9 times in 1961 before falling back to a more moderate level in recent years.\n","\n","These figures provide some useful information for investors, but they should not be taken as a guarantee of future returns. The stock market is a volatile place, and there is always the risk of losing money. Investors should always do their own research and make their own decisions about whether or not to invest in the stock market.\n","This table shows the stock market performance from 1871 to 1970. The average price of stocks increased from 3.58 to 93.25, with an average annual growth rate of 5.8%. The average earnings per share increased from 0.32 to 5.60, with an average annual growth rate of 4.2%. The average dividend per share increased from 0.21 to 3.13, with an average annual growth rate of 4.3%. The average P/E ratio increased from 11.3 to 16.7. The average yield decreased from 6.0% to 3.3%. The average payout ratio decreased from 67% to 56%.\n","\n","In 1972, the DJIA was at 900 and the S&P composite index was at 100. The author concludes that the market is at a dangerous level and that there will be serious losses in the future.\n","In the previous edition, the author evaluated the stock market level of 1964 as \"too high\" and advised investors to \"choose the path of caution\". The author then went on to say that \"it is doubtful if [these judgments] have been as useful as our more pedestrian counsels—in favor of a consistent and controlled common-stock policy on the one hand, and discouraging endeavors to 'beat the market' or to 'pick the winners' on the other.\"\n","\n","In this edition, the author revisits the question of whether the stock market is overvalued and provides a more nuanced analysis. The author notes that the price-to-earnings ratio for the market was lower in October 1971 than at year-end 1963 and 1968. It was about the same as in 1958, but much higher than in the early years of the long bull market.\n","\n","The author concludes by saying that \"it is difficult to reach a definite conclusion as to whether the present level of the stock market is too high or not.\" However, the author does provide some general advice for investors, such as \"avoiding excessive risk\" and \"concentrating on stocks with good long-term prospects.\"\n","None\n","In this chapter, Graham warns investors against extrapolating the past to predict the future. He argues that the intelligent investor must always be aware of the risks involved in investing and must never pay too much for a stock.\n","He also discusses the dangers of market bubbles and how they can lead to devastating losses for investors.\n","Finally, he provides some tips on how to value stocks and identify potential bargains.\n","None\n","Chapter 3 of the book \"The Intelligent Investor\" discusses the relationship between stock prices and future returns. It argues that stocks are typically priced at a premium to their long-term earnings growth, and that this premium is often justified by the potential for capital gains. However, when stocks are priced at a high multiple of their earnings, the future returns are likely to be lower.\n","\n","The chapter also discusses the importance of diversification and the need to maintain a balanced portfolio. It concludes by arguing that the intelligent investor should be willing to take risks in order to achieve a higher return, but that these risks should be carefully managed.\n","The author suggests that the defensive investor should divide his funds between high-grade bonds and high-grade common stocks.\n","The author proposes a 50-50 stock-bond allocation as a simple and effective way to balance risk and return.\n","The author also discusses the choice of bonds in the bond component, and suggests that investors should consider tax-exempt bonds and shorter-term maturities.\n","The chapter discusses the different types of bonds and their features. It starts by explaining the difference between taxable and tax-exempt bonds, and how the choice of one over the other depends on the investor's tax bracket.\n","\n","The chapter then lists a few major types of bonds that deserve investor consideration, and discusses them briefly with respect to general description, safety, yield, market price, risk, income-tax status, and other features.\n","\n","The first type of bond discussed is U.S. savings bonds, series E and series H. The chapter summarizes their important provisions, and then discusses briefly the numerous advantages of these unique, attractive, and exceedingly convenient investments.\n","\n","The second type of bond discussed is other U.S. bonds. The chapter notes that all of them are completely safe with respect to payment of interest and principal, and that they are subject to Federal income taxes but free from state income tax. The chapter also notes that in 1970 it was possible to buy a number of old issues at large discounts.\n","\n","The chapter concludes by discussing the indirect obligations of the U.S. government. The chapter notes that in many cases these obligations yield appreciably more than the direct obligations of the same maturity. The chapter also notes that the chief reason for this situation has been the debt limit imposed on government borrowing by the Congress.\n","Chapter 6: The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","In this chapter, we will discuss the effects of market fluctuations on bonds and stocks, and how investors should react to them.\n","\n","## The Effects of Market Fluctuations on Bonds\n","\n","Bond prices are affected by changes in interest rates. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice versa. This is because when interest rates rise, new bonds can be issued with higher yields, making existing bonds less attractive to investors.\n","\n","The impact of interest rate changes on bond prices is not uniform across all bonds. Short-term bonds are more sensitive to interest rate changes than long-term bonds. This is because the value of a bond is determined by its yield to maturity, which is the interest rate that the bond would pay if it were held to maturity. For a given change in interest rates, the yield to maturity of a short-term bond will change more than the yield to maturity of a long-term bond.\n","\n","In addition to interest rate changes, bond prices can also be affected by other factors, such as changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer, changes in the economic outlook, and changes in investor sentiment.\n","\n","## How Investors Should React to Market Fluctuations\n","\n","The best way for investors to react to market fluctuations is to have a long-term investment horizon and to avoid making emotional decisions. When markets are volatile, it can be tempting to sell your investments in a panic. However, this is usually the worst thing you can do. If you sell your investments when the market is down, you will lock in your losses.\n","\n","Instead of selling your investments when the market is down, you should focus on rebalancing your portfolio. This means selling your investments that have performed well and buying investments that have performed poorly. By rebalancing your portfolio, you can help to ensure that your investments are properly diversified and that you are not taking on too much risk.\n","\n","It is also important to remember that market fluctuations are a normal part of investing. Over the long term, the stock market has always trended upwards. This means that if you stay invested for the long term, you are likely to see your investments grow in value.\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","In this chapter, we have discussed the effects of market fluctuations on bonds and stocks. We have also discussed how investors should react to market fluctuations. The key takeaway is that the best way to weather market fluctuations is to have a long-term investment horizon and to avoid making emotional decisions.\n","Page 1: It is better to buy a low-coupon bond at a discount rather than a high-coupon bond selling at about par and callable in a few years.\n","Page 2: Preferred stocks are not good investments because they lack both the legal claim of the bondholder and the profit possibilities of a common shareholder.\n","Page 3: Income bonds should be used by corporations more extensively because they have several practical advantages over preferred stocks.\n","Chapter 4 discusses how to allocate your assets between stocks, bonds, and cash. Graham's advice is to keep a minimum of 25% in bonds, as this will give you the courage to keep the rest of your money in stocks even when stocks stink.\n","He also emphasizes that the amount of risk you can take depends on your personal circumstances, such as your age, income, and expenses.\n","This chapter discusses how to determine the asset allocation for your 401(k) plan. It provides a framework for assessing your risk tolerance and suggests that you rebalance your portfolio every six months.\n","The chapter also discusses the different types of bonds and how to choose between taxable and tax-free bonds.\n","This chapter discusses the different types of bonds and how to invest in them. It provides a table summarizing the pros and cons of each type of bond.\n","The chapter also discusses the importance of diversification and the benefits of using bond funds.\n","Finally, it provides a few examples of cash alternatives to bank certificates of deposit and money-market accounts.\n","Chapter 4 of The Intelligent Investor discusses the different types of bonds and preferred stocks that are available to investors. It also provides an overview of common stocks and their investment merits.\n","\n","- U.S. Treasury bonds are the safest bonds available and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n","- Municipal bonds are issued by state and local governments and are exempt from federal income tax.\n","- Corporate bonds are issued by companies and are subject to default risk.\n","- Preferred stocks are a hybrid of bonds and common stocks. They have a fixed dividend payment but do not participate in the company's growth.\n","- Common stocks are the most volatile type of investment but also offer the potential for the highest returns.\n","\n","The chapter concludes by arguing that even defensive investors should consider adding some stocks to their portfolios in order to increase their income yield and potential return.\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses the role of common stocks in a defensive investor's portfolio. He argues that common stocks have historically offered two main advantages over bonds: protection against inflation and higher average returns. However, he warns that these benefits can be lost if stocks are purchased at too high a price.\n","Graham then provides four rules for selecting common stocks for a defensive investor's portfolio: adequate diversification, large, prominent, and conservatively financed companies, a long record of continuous dividend payments, and a price-to-earnings ratio of no more than 25 times average earnings over the past seven years.\n","He concludes by arguing that growth stocks, which have been the favorites of both speculators and institutional investors, are not suitable for defensive investors because their prices are typically too high.\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses the risks associated with growth stocks and recommends that defensive investors focus on large companies with relatively low P/E ratios. He also discusses the importance of periodic portfolio reviews and the benefits of dollar-cost averaging.\n","Chapter 5 of the book \"The Intelligent Investor\" discusses the different investment strategies for defensive and enterprising investors.\n","\n","- Defensive investors should invest in a portfolio of high-quality bonds and blue-chip stocks.\n","- Enterprising investors should be more aggressive and take on more risk in search of higher returns.\n","- The type of securities that an investor should purchase and the rate of return they should seek depends on their financial resources, knowledge, experience, and temperament.\n","- The term \"risk\" is often used in two different ways: (1) the risk of default on a bond or dividend payment, and (2) the risk of a decline in the price of a security.\n","- The book argues that the second type of risk is not a true risk in the sense that it does not affect the long-term value of the investment.\n","Chapter 5 discusses the role of common stocks in a defensive investor's portfolio.\n","- A defensive investor should only invest in large, prominent, and conservatively financed corporations.\n","- The term \"large\" and \"prominent\" are ambiguous and can be interpreted differently by different investors.\n","- The book provides some arbitrary criteria for what constitutes a large and prominent company, but ultimately it is up to the investor to decide what they consider to be a good investment.\n","- The chapter also discusses the recent stock market crash and how it has affected investors' perception of risk.\n","- The author argues that the crash has actually reduced the risk of investing in stocks, as prices are now more reasonable.\n","- He concludes by saying that defensive investors should still consider investing in stocks, as long as they are priced reasonably and are expected to provide future growth.\n","Chapter 5 discusses the importance of owning stocks, even for defensive investors. It then warns against the common mistake of \"buying what you know\" without doing any research. This is often done by investors who are familiar with a company's products or services, but do not fully understand its financial statements or business value. This can lead to overpaying for stocks and ultimately losing money.\n","The chapter concludes by discussing the importance of doing your homework and diversifying your investments.\n","Page 1: The chapter discusses how to buy stocks, including through online brokerages, direct stock purchase programs, discount brokers, financial planners, and full-service stockbrokers. It also discusses the benefits of mutual funds and index funds.\n","Page 2: The chapter discusses dollar-cost averaging and how to use it to buy index funds. It provides an example of how to dollar-cost average $500 a month into three index funds.\n","None\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses the investment strategy for the aggressive investor. He argues that the aggressive investor should focus on high-quality bonds and avoid high-coupon issues and second-grade bonds and preferred stocks. He provides several examples to support his argument.\n","The author warns investors against buying second-grade bonds and preferred stocks, as well as foreign government bonds and new issues. He argues that these investments are often sold at inflated prices and are therefore more likely to lose value in the future.\n","He also points out that new issues are often sold with high commissions, which further reduces the investor's return.\n","In the first page, Graham discusses the two types of common-stock financing: (1) additional shares offered pro rata to existing stockholders and (2) the placement with the public of common stock of what were formerly privately owned enterprises. He argues that the second type of financing is more dangerous for the public because it often involves relatively small companies with poor track records that are priced exorbitantly.\n","In the second page, Graham describes how the pattern of new common-stock flotations tends to follow the bull market. He notes that the first offerings are priced attractively and that some investors make large profits. However, as the market rise continues, the quality of the companies becomes steadily poorer and the prices asked and obtained become exorbitant. He concludes by saying that one fairly dependable sign of the approaching end of a bull swing is the fact that new common stocks of small and nondescript companies are offered at prices somewhat higher than the current level for many medium-sized companies with a long market history.\n","In this chapter, Graham warns investors against the dangers of investing in new common stock issues during bull markets. He argues that these investments are often overpriced and that the vast majority of them will eventually lose value. He also cautions against investing in high-yield bonds, which he believes are too risky for the average investor.\n","Chapter 6: The Vodka and Burrito Portfolio\n","- Junk bonds are not a good investment because they are risky and often do not pay off.\n","- Emerging-markets bond funds can be a good investment for investors who can withstand risk.\n","- Day trading is a bad investment because it is likely to lose money.\n","- Investors should be patient and not try to time the market.\n","Chapter 6 of the book \"The Intelligent Investor\" talks about the importance of being a long-term investor and the dangers of trading frequently.\n","- The costs of trading can erode your returns.\n","- The more you trade, the less you keep.\n","- The early bird gets wormed.\n","- Most IPOs are terrible investments.\n","- You can't time the market.\n","In this chapter, the author discusses the dangers of investing in IPOs. He argues that IPOs are often overpriced and that most of the gains are captured by institutional investors. He also provides the example of VA Linux, a company that went from $30 to $239 on its first day of trading, but then crashed to $1.19 three years later.\n","The author concludes that IPOs should be avoided by most investors.\n","Chapter 7 discusses the enterprising investor's portfolio policy.\n","- The enterprising investor may be interested in special opportunities in tax-free bonds, such as New Housing Authority bonds and New Community bonds.\n","- The enterprising investor may also be interested in bargain issues of various types, such as distressed or defaulted bonds.\n","- The enterprising investor may also be interested in buying into “special situations,” such as companies in (or approaching) bankruptcy.\n","- The enterprising investor may also consider buying carefully chosen “growth stocks.”\n","- A growth stock may be defined as one that has done better than the average over a period of years and is expected to do so in the future.\n","- However, simply picking out the 15 or 20 most likely looking issues of a group of companies that have outperformed the averages in the past is not a guaranteed way to success.\n","- The enterprising investor should carefully consider the financial strength of the company, its growth prospects, and its management team before making an investment.\n","Page 1: - Growth stocks are companies with good records and apparently good prospects.\n","- The investor may be right in his judgment of their prospects and still not fare particularly well, merely because he has paid in full (and perhaps overpaid) for the expected prosperity.\n","- Unusually rapid growth cannot keep up forever; when a company has already registered a brilliant expansion, its very increase in size makes a repetition of its achievement more difficult.\n","- The average intelligent investor, even with much devoted effort, cannot derive better results over the years from the purchase of growth stocks than the investment companies specializing in this area.\n","Page 2: - Growth stocks as a class tend toward wide swings in market price.\n","- The more enthusiastic the public grows about a company, and the faster its advance as compared with the actual growth in its earnings, the riskier a proposition it becomes.\n","Page 3: - The big fortunes from single-company investments are almost always realized by persons who have a great deal of money to start with and who are willing to take substantial risks.\n","This article is about the three recommended fields for enterprising investment.\n","The first one is to invest in relatively unpopular large companies. The author argues that the market tends to overvalue companies that have been showing excellent growth or are glamorous for some other reason, and it will undervalue companies that are out of favor because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature. This means that the enterprising investor can buy these unpopular companies at a discount and sell them when they become popular again.\n","The second field is to invest in cyclical stocks. The author argues that cyclical stocks tend to go through periods of high and low prices, and the enterprising investor can buy them when they are cheap and sell them when they are expensive.\n","The third field is to invest in small-cap stocks. The author argues that small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks over the long term.\n","The chapter discusses the benefits of buying cheap stocks and bargain issues.\n","\n","- Buying cheap stocks has been shown to outperform the market in the long term.\n","- A cheap stock is defined as one that is selling for significantly less than its intrinsic value.\n","- There are two ways to determine the intrinsic value of a stock: the appraisal method and the value to a private owner.\n","- At market lows, a large proportion of common stocks are bargain issues.\n","- Investors should be careful not to overpay for bargain stocks, as they can still decline in value.\n","The author discusses two main sources of undervaluation: (1) currently disappointing results and (2) protracted neglect or unpopularity.\n","He then provides examples of each, such as Chrysler Corporation and National Presto Industries.\n","Finally, he discusses a third cause for an unduly low price for a common stock: the market's failure to recognize its true earnings picture.\n","He uses Northern Pacific Railway as an example.\n","The author then presents a table summarizing the results of buying one share of each of the 85 companies in a list of net-current-asset value stocks and holding them for two years.\n","The gain for the entire \"portfolio\" in that period was 75%, against 50% for Standard & Poor's 425 industrials.\n","What is more remarkable is that none of the issues showed significant losses, seven held about even, and 78 showed appreciable gains.\n","The text discusses the strategy of buying undervalued stocks, focusing on secondary companies. It argues that secondary companies are often undervalued because investors are too pessimistic about their future prospects. The text provides several reasons why investors can profit from buying undervalued secondary companies, including the relatively high dividend yield, the potential for capital appreciation, and the fact that secondary companies tend to outperform the market over time.\n","Page 1: This page discusses the concept of bargain stocks and special situations. Bargain stocks are stocks that are trading at a discount from their intrinsic value. Special situations are investments that arise from corporate events, such as mergers and acquisitions.\n","Page 2: This page discusses the risks and rewards of investing in special situations. It concludes that special situations are a technical branch of investment that requires a considerable knowledge of security values.\n","Page 3: This page discusses the broader implications of the rules for investment. It concludes that the aggressive investor must have a considerable knowledge of security values and that there is no room in this philosophy for a passive investor.\n","The author discusses the difference between defensive and enterprising investors. Defensive investors should invest in assets with high certainty of return and low risk, while enterprising investors should be willing to take on more risk in pursuit of higher returns. The author then discusses the three categories of securities that enterprising investors should avoid buying at full price: foreign bonds, preferred stocks, and secondary common stocks. He argues that these securities are only worth buying at a discount, and that the average investor should not purchase them at full price.\n","Chapter 7 of the book \"The Intelligent Investor\" discusses the importance of not trying to time the market and the dangers of buying growth stocks at too high a price.\n","\n","The author, Benjamin Graham, argues that market timing is impossible and that investors are better off buying and holding stocks for the long term. He also warns that growth stocks can be very expensive and that investors should be careful not to overpay for them.\n","The chapter discusses the risks of investing in growth stocks, which are companies with rapidly growing revenues and earnings. The author provides several examples of companies that have seen their stock prices decline significantly after their growth rates slowed down. He also warns investors not to fall for the hype surrounding these companies and to be wary of paying too much for their stocks.\n","Chapter 7 of the book \"The Intelligent Investor\" discusses the importance of diversification and investing in foreign markets.\n","- Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Although concentrating your investments in a single industry or company can lead to big gains, it also increases the risk of losing everything.\n","- Graham's criteria for bargains include stocks that are selling for less than their net working capital and stocks that have hit new lows for the past year.\n","- Investing in foreign stocks is advisable because it helps to diversify your portfolio and reduce your risk.\n","- The Japanese should never have kept all their money at home. Similarly, you should not put all your money in U.S. stocks. Putting up to a third of your stock money in mutual funds that hold foreign stocks (including those in emerging markets) helps insure against the risk that our own backyard may not always be the best place in the world to invest.\n","Chapter 8: The Investor and Market Fluctuations\n","- Investors should be aware of the possibility of market fluctuations and should prepare for them both financially and psychologically.\n","- Investors should not speculate, as they will likely lose money in the end.\n","- The intelligent investor can derive satisfactory results from pricing stocks, either by buying them when they are undervalued or by selling them when they are overvalued.\n","- Market forecasting is a waste of time and effort for the average investor, as it is impossible to predict market movements with any degree of accuracy.\n","- The only way to make money in the stock market is to buy good companies and hold them for the long term.\n","The investor should not try to time the market because it is impossible to predict future market movements.

He argues that a stock is not a good investment simply because it is trading at a low price, but rather that it should also have a strong financial position and a history of generating consistent earnings. He then uses the example of A. & P. to illustrate how a stock's price can fluctuate wildly over time, and how investors who are willing to buy stocks at a discount can sometimes make substantial gains.\n","None\n","None\n","The price of bonds has fluctuated considerably over the years. It is impossible to predict the future price of bonds. If investors want to be certain that the market values will not decrease, they should choose U.S. savings bonds. If investors want a higher yield, they should be prepared to see their bonds fluctuate in price.\n","Convertible bonds and preferred stocks are subject to three different factors: variations in the price of the related common stock, variations in the credit standing of the company, and variations in general interest rates.\n","A good long-term bond of the future would have a principal value of about 100, if the company maintains its credit rating, but the interest received will vary, say, with the rate offered on conventional new issues.\n","Over the past decade, bond investors have been confronted by an increasingly serious dilemma: Shall he choose complete stability of principal value, but with varying and usually low (short-term) interest rates? Or shall he choose a fixed-interest income, with considerable variations (usually downward, it seems) in his principal value?\n","It would be good for most investors if they could compromise between these extremes, and be assured that neither their interest return nor their principal value will fall below a stated minimum over, say, a 20-year period.\n","Chapter 8 of the book \"The Intelligent Investor\" discusses the concept of Mr. Market.\n","Mr. Market is a metaphor for the stock market and its irrational behavior.\n","When Mr. Market is in a good mood, he prices stocks too high.\n","When Mr. Market is in a bad mood, he prices stocks too low.\n","Investors should be aware of Mr. Market's mood swings and not let them\n","influence their investment decisions.\n","Inktomi Corp. is an example of a company whose stock price was\n","mispriced by Mr. Market.\n","Inktomi's stock price went from $231.625 to 25 cents in two and a half years.\n","This was due to Mr. Market's irrational exuberance in early 2000 and\n","his subsequent depression in late 2002.\n","Despite the volatility of Mr. Market, Yahoo!

Open-end funds are the most common type of mutual fund and allow investors to buy and sell shares directly with the fund company. Closed-end funds trade on stock exchanges like stocks, and their prices can fluctuate based on supply and demand. ETFs are also traded on stock exchanges, but they track an index or other benchmark, rather than being actively managed.\n","\n","When choosing a mutual fund, you should consider your investment goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.

A down payment on a house? A child's education?\n","* Your time horizon: How long do you plan to hold the investment?\n","* Your risk tolerance: How comfortable are you with taking on risk?\n","* The fees and expenses of the fund: How much will you pay in fees each year?\n","\n","Once you have considered these factors, you can start to compare different funds. You can use websites like Morningstar.com or Kiplinger.com to compare funds based on their performance, fees, and other factors.\n","\n","It is important to remember that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. When choosing a mutual fund, you should always do your own research and make sure that the fund is a good fit for your investment goals.\n","This article is about the performance of mutual funds.

It argues that closed-end funds can be a good investment if they are purchased at a discount and that the risk of a wider discount is small. However, it also cautions that investors should be aware of the potential for higher fees and wider price swings.\n","\n","The article also discusses the performance of balanced funds and argues that investors are better off making their own bond investments directly.\n","Chapter 9 of the book \"The Intelligent Investor\" discusses the topic of mutual funds. The author begins by stating that mutual funds are almost perfect, but not quite. He then goes on to discuss the importance of choosing funds carefully and avoiding the temptation to buy funds based on their past performance. He also warns investors about the dangers of sector funds, which tend to perform poorly over time.\n","The author of this text explains why it is so difficult to find a good mutual fund. He states that past performance is not a good predictor of future returns and that funds with high past returns are unlikely to remain winners for long. He also discusses the challenges that successful funds face, such as rising expenses, herding behavior, and the departure of talented managers.\n","\n","In the next page, the author discusses the factors that you can use to increase your odds of finding a good fund. He recommends looking for funds with low expenses, low turnover, and a long track record of success. He also suggests avoiding funds with high volatility and funds that have recently experienced a surge in popularity.\n","Page 1: Most funds fail to earn their keep because of their fat costs and bad behavior. Index funds, which own all the stocks in the market, all the time, without any pretense of being able to select the \"best\" and avoid the \"worst\", will beat most funds over the long run. Their rock-bottom overhead give the index fund an insurmountable advantage.\n","Page 2: Index funds have only one significant flaw: They are boring. Their managers are the biggest shareholders. They are cheap. They dare to be different.\n","The best mutual funds often close to new investors, don't advertise, and have low expenses.\n","- The best funds have managers who are major shareholders, dare to be different, don't hype their returns, and have shown a willingness to shut down before they get too big.\n","- When evaluating risk, look at a fund's worst loss over a calendar quarter.\n","- When looking at past performance, remember that it is only a pale predictor of future returns.\n","- Avoid funds with consistently poor past returns, especially if they have above-average annual expenses.\n","- Closed-end stock funds are not always available at a discount in what has become a dusty, dwindling market.\n","- The new breed of exchange-traded index funds can be worth exploring as well. These low-cost “ETFs” sometimes offer the only means by which an investor can gain entrée to a narrow market.\n","Page 1: The author discusses when to sell a fund. He says that it is not a good idea to sell a fund just because it has underperformed the market for a few years.

He argues that investors should not focus too much on small differences in earnings from one year to the next, but should instead focus on the company's long-term growth rate. He also cautions investors against being misled by accounting gimmicks that can artificially inflate a company's earnings.\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses the importance of considering a company's past growth rate and earnings when valuing a stock. He uses ALCOA as an example of a company with excellent past growth but a low stock price. He argues that this is because the market is pessimistic about the company's future prospects. He then suggests using a two-part appraisal process to value stocks, taking into account both their past performance and their future prospects.\n","\n","In the commentary, Jason Zweig discusses the accounting tricks that companies used to inflate their earnings in the past few years.

It also provides a table of data on the 15 stocks in the Dow Jones Utility Average and a second list of 15 other utilities taken from the New York Stock Exchange list.\n","Chapter 14 of the book \"The Intelligent Investor\" by Benjamin Graham, discusses the defensive investor's approach to selecting stocks. This chapter focuses on public utility stocks and financial companies.\n","\n","* Public utility stocks are attractive to defensive investors because they are typically priced at a moderate price in relation to book value.\n","* Financial companies are also a good option for defensive investors, but it is important to carefully assess the financial soundness of each company before investing.\n","* Railroad stocks are not a good option for defensive investors due to the severe competition and strict regulation that the industry faces.\n","Page 1: Railroads have been a difficult investment historically, with more than half of the mileage in bankruptcy at various times. However, there have been prosperous periods as well.\n","Page 2: It is usually unsound to make blanket recommendations of whole classes of securities. The current price of each prominent stock pretty well reflects the salient factors in its financial record plus the general opinion as to its future prospects.\n","Page 3: There are two basically different approaches to security analysis: the way of prediction (or projection) and the way of protection.\n","\n","The connection between the pages is that they all discuss different aspects of stock selection for the defensive investor.\n","There are two approaches to stock selection: the predictive approach and the protective approach. The predictive approach emphasizes prospects, management, and other non-measurable factors, while the protective approach emphasizes the measurable relationships between selling price and earnings, assets, dividends, etc. The quantitative approach is an extension of the viewpoint that security analysis has found to be sound in the selection of bonds and preferred stocks for investment.\n","\n","The defensive investor should emphasize diversification more than individual selection. He should buy a total stock-market index fund that holds essentially every stock worth having. A low-cost index fund is the best tool ever created for low-maintenance stock investing.\n","Page 1: This page discusses the importance of diversification and how it can help investors minimize their risk of loss. It also discusses the concept of \"superstocks\" and how they can help investors maximize their returns.\n","Page 2: This page provides an update on Graham's criteria for stock selection. It discusses the importance of adequate size and strong financial condition. It also provides a table of companies that met Graham's criteria in early 2003.\n","This chapter discusses the criteria that Benjamin Graham used to select stocks for his investment portfolio. These criteria include financial strength, earnings stability, dividend record, and earnings growth.\n","\n","Graham's criterion of financial strength is that a company's current assets should be at least double its current liabilities, and its long-term debt should not exceed working capital.\n","\n","Graham also believed that a company's earnings should be stable over time, and that it should have a long history of paying dividends. He also believed that a company's earnings should grow over time.\n","\n","The chapter concludes by providing a list of companies that meet Graham's criteria for stock selection.\n","In this chapter, Graham presents a set of criteria to select stocks for defensive investors. He suggests that investors should look for stocks with a long history of dividend payments, a moderate price-to-earnings ratio, and a moderate price-to-book ratio. He also recommends that investors do their homework and check out the neighborhood before investing in a stock.\n","This chapter discusses the difficulty of stock selection and why mutual funds, on average, underperform the market.\n","Two possible explanations are given:\n","1. The stock market reflects all the important information about a company, making it difficult to predict future stock prices.\n","2. Many analysts use the same flawed approach to stock selection, which focuses on finding companies with the best growth prospects.\n","This suggests that the enterprising investor who wants to make individual selections that will yield superior results is taking on a very difficult task.\n","In this chapter, Graham presents a summary of the investment methods used by Graham-Newman Corporation during its 30-year life, from 1926 to 1956.\n","These methods were based on the following principles:\n","(1) The purchase of securities that were undervalued by the market.\n","(2) The use of leverage to magnify the potential returns from these investments.\n","(3) The diversification of the portfolio to reduce risk.\n","Graham-Newman Corporation was successful in implementing these principles and generated annual returns of 20% or more over its 30-year history.\n","However, Graham cautions that these methods are not suitable for all investors. The defensive investor, who is by definition an amateur, should not attempt to use these methods.\n","The aggressive investor, on the other hand, may be more suited to these methods, but should still exercise caution and not overpay for stocks.\n","Graham concludes by saying that the enterprising investor should focus on finding undervalued stocks in industries and companies about which they hold an optimistic view.\n","In this chapter, Graham introduces the concept of enterprising investors and discusses how they differ from defensive investors. Enterprising investors are willing to take on more risk in search of higher returns. They are more likely to invest in cyclical companies that are out of favor with the market. Graham provides a detailed example of how enterprising investors can use the Standard & Poor's Stock Guide to find undervalued stocks.\n","The chapter discusses the selection of common stocks by an enterprising investor. The author suggests a six-step process to identify potential candidates, including a review of the company's financial statements, earnings stability, dividend record, earnings growth, and price. The author then presents a sample portfolio of 15 stocks that meet all six criteria and discusses the results of a series of experiments based on a single, fairly obvious criterion. The most important fact that emerges from the tests is the performance of stocks bought at random. The author concludes that the intelligent investor should avoid small issues of inferior quality.\n","The author suggests that investors should avoid second-quality issues in making up a portfolio, unless they are demonstrable bargains.\n","The author also found that companies that combined major size with a large good-will component in their market price did very well as a whole in the 2 1⁄2-year holding period.\n","Finally, the author suggests that investors should consider buying stocks at a price less than their net-current-asset value.\n","The author discusses the difference between “bargain issues” and “special situations” and provides examples of each.\n","- Bargain issues are stocks that are trading below their intrinsic value.\n","- Special situations are stocks that are involved in a merger or acquisition.\n","The author argues that both types of stocks can be profitable for investors, but that special situations are riskier.\n","He concludes by saying that investors should only invest in special situations if they have the experience and knowledge to do so.\n","Chapter 15 of the book \"The Intelligent Investor\" discusses different stock selection techniques used by some of today's leading money managers.\n","- Practice first, just as even the greatest athletes and musicians practice and rehearse before every actual performance.\n","- Look for stocks that are unfashionable or unloved and that thus offer the potential for high returns once perceptions change.\n","- Consider using a portfolio tracker to test-drive your techniques before trying them with real money.\n","- After a year, measure your results against how you would have done if you had put all your money in an S & P 500 index fund.\n","In this chapter, the author presents additional criteria that value investors use to select stocks.\n","First, they look for companies with rising returns on invested capital (ROIC).\n","Second, they analyze each of the company's divisions to see if they are worth more than the current stock price.\n","Finally, they look for companies run by people who are honest and transparent with shareholders.\n","The author also provides some tips on how to find out which leading professional money managers own the same stocks you do.\n","None\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses convertible bonds and warrants. He argues that convertible bonds are not as attractive as they seem and that they are often issued during speculative periods. He also provides data showing that convertible bonds have performed worse than other investments during bear markets.\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses convertible issues and warrants. He argues that convertible issues are often not as desirable as non-convertible or \"straight\" securities, and that they tend to be floated and purchased in the latter stages of a bull market. He also warns investors against converting convertible bonds into common stock, as this can often lead to losses.\n","\n","In the following pages, Graham provides several examples of convertible issues that have performed poorly in declining stock markets. He also discusses the case of Eversharp Co., a company whose convertible debentures were called at a small premium and then converted into common stock. The stock price promptly began a severe decline, and the original purchasers of the debentures lost 75% of their investment.\n","\n","Graham concludes the chapter by advising investors to be wary of new convertible issues. He believes that they are often issued by companies with weak underlying businesses and that they are more likely to perform poorly in a declining stock market.\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses convertible bonds and warrants. He argues that convertible bonds are not as attractive as they seem and that investors should be wary of them. He also points out that convertible bonds can be used to dilute the value of common stock. Finally, he suggests that investors who own common stock in companies that have issued convertible bonds or warrants should consider switching to the preferred stock.\n","Page 1: Convertible preferred stock is a hybrid security that has characteristics of both debt and equity. It can be converted into common stock at a predetermined price. The conversion ratio is the number of common shares that can be received for each convertible preferred share.\n","\n","Convertible preferred stock is often used as a way to raise capital for a company. It can be attractive to investors because it offers a fixed dividend payment and the potential for capital appreciation if the common stock price increases.\n","\n","Page 2: Stock-option warrants are a type of call option that gives the holder the right to buy a specified number of shares of common stock at a predetermined price. Warrants are typically issued as part of a company's initial public offering (IPO) or as a sweetener for a debt or equity offering.\n","\n","Warrants can be a valuable tool for investors because they provide leverage and the potential for significant gains if the stock price increases. However, they also carry a high degree of risk, and investors should carefully consider the risks before investing in warrants.\n","\n","Page 3: Graham believes that convertible preferred stock and stock-option warrants are both dangerous investments. He argues that convertible preferred stock is essentially a debt security with a low yield and limited upside potential. He also believes that stock-option warrants are a form of gambling and that they should be avoided by all but the most sophisticated investors.\n","In this chapter, Graham explains the difference between convertible bonds and warrants. He argues that warrants are a form of \"paper money\" that should be avoided by investors. He also provides a commentary on convertible bonds, explaining how they work and why they can be risky investments.\n","Chapter 16 of the Intelligent Investor discusses convertible bonds.\n","- Convertible bonds offer less income and more risk than most other bonds.\n","- Convertible bonds act more like stocks than bonds.\n","- Convertible bonds are a good investment for conservative investors who want to seek stock-like returns without having to invest in stocks directly.\n","- Convertible bonds are now medium-term, in the seven-to-10-year range; roughly half are investment-grade; and many issues now carry some call protection (an assurance against early redemption). All these factors make them less risky than they used to be.\n","- It's expensive to trade small lots of convertible bonds, and diversification is impractical unless you have well over $100,000 to invest in this sector alone.\n","- Today's intelligent investor has the convenient recourse of buying a low-cost convertible bond fund.\n","- Convertible bonds are not without risk. Most convertible bonds remain junior to other long-term debt and bank loans—so, in a bankruptcy, convertible holders do not have prior claim to the company's assets.\n","- Convertible bonds are often issued by companies with less than sterling credit ratings.\n","- A large portion of the convertible market is held by hedge funds, whose rapid-fire trading can increase the volatility of prices.\n","Chapter 17 of the book \"The Intelligent Investor\" presents four case studies of companies that illustrate different investment extremes.\n","- The Penn Central case study shows how a company can go bankrupt even if it is the largest railroad in the country. The authors argue that the bankruptcy could have been avoided if investors had paid attention to the company's financial statements.\n","- The Ling-Temco-Vought case study shows how a company can grow too quickly and become overleveraged. The authors argue that this company's collapse was inevitable due to its aggressive acquisition strategy.\n","- The NVF Corp case study shows how a company can use accounting gimmicks to inflate its earnings. The authors argue that investors should be skeptical of companies that report unusually high earnings.\n","- The AAA Enterprises case study shows how a company can be overvalued based on hype and speculation. The authors argue that investors should do their own research before investing in a company.\n","In this chapter, Graham presents two case studies of companies that went bankrupt: Penn Central and Ling-Temco-Vought.\n","\n","- Penn Central: The railroad's operating ratio was 47.5% in 1968, which was much higher than its competitor Norfolk & Western's 35.2%.\n","- Ling-Temco-Vought: The company grew rapidly through acquisitions, using its stock to pay for them. By 1969, LTV was the 14th biggest firm on the Fortune 500 list of major U.S. corporations. However, the company's financial situation quickly deteriorated and it filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2000.\n","\n","Graham concludes that investors should avoid companies with high debt levels and those that are growing primarily through acquisitions.\n","Page 1:\n","- Ling-Temco-Vought's stock price rose to 22 times its reported asset value in 1967.\n","- Two of our best-regarded banking firms offered 600,000 shares of Ling-Temco-Vought stock at $111 per share.\n","- The company's losses in 1969 and 1970 far exceeded the total profits since the formation of the company.\n","\n","Page 2:\n","- NVF Company had $4.6 million of long-term debt, $17.4 million of stock capital, $31 million of sales, and $502,000 of net income (before a special credit of $374,000).\n","- Sharon Steel Corp. had $43 million of long-term debt, $101 million of stock capital, $219 million of sales, and $2,929,000 of net earnings.\n","- NVF acquired 88% of the Sharon stock under the offer, issuing therefore $102 million of its 5% bonds and warrants for 2,197,000 of its shares.\n","- The company subsequently stated them as a net loss of 50 cents per share of NVF stocks, before an extraordinary credit, and net earnings of 3 cents per share after such credit.\n","Page 1: This page discusses the accounting gimmicks used by National Ventures, Inc. (NVF) to reduce its taxes. These gimmicks include the use of deferred debt expense and the amortization of equity over cost of investment in subsidiary.\n","Page 2: This page discusses other unusual items in NVF's financial statements, such as the purchase of warrants at a high price, the retirement of bonds in exchange for common stock, and the sale of warrants to employees.\n","Page 3: This page discusses the history of AAA Enterprises, a company that was founded by a college student named Jackie G. Williams. AAA Enterprises sold mobile homes and later announced that it would come up with a new franchising concept every month. However, the company ran out of time and money before Williams ran out of ideas.\n","AAA Enterprises was a company founded by Mr. Williams in 1968. In 1969, the company went public and the stock price doubled. However, the company soon lost money and filed for bankruptcy in 1971. This case study illustrates the dangers of investing in speculative stocks.\n","In this chapter, Graham highlights four extremes:\n","1. An overpriced \"tottering giant\"\n","2. An empire-building conglomerate\n","3. A merger in which a tiny firm took over a big one\n","4. An initial public offering of shares in a basically worthless company\n","He then uses Lucent Technologies Inc. as an example of a company that fits the first extreme.\n","Page 1: The author discusses the acquisition of Chromatis by Lucent Technologies and the subsequent write-offs of goodwill and capitalized software.\n","Page 2: The author discusses Tyco International Ltd.'s acquisition strategy and the resulting MORON, CHILLA, and WOOPIPRAD charges.\n","Page 3: The author discusses the merger of America Online, Inc. and Time Warner Inc. and the resulting stock price appreciation for Time Warner shareholders.\n","\n","The main connection between the pages is that they all discuss accounting issues related to mergers and acquisitions.\n","Page 1: AOL Time Warner Inc. was formed in 2000 by the merger of America Online and Time Warner. The deal was approved by Time Warner shareholders, despite the fact that America Online's shareholders would own 55% of the combined company and that the SEC was investigating America Online's accounting practices.\n","Page 2: eToys Inc. went public in 1999 and its stock price soared 282.8% on its first day of trading. However, the company had never made a profit and had accumulated losses of $30.8 million. It also planned to use some of the proceeds from the offering to acquire another money-losing company, BabyCenter, Inc.\n","Page 3: eToys filed for bankruptcy protection in 2001 after racking up net losses of more than $398 million. Its stock, which peaked at $86 per share in 2000, last traded for a penny.\n","\n","The connection between the pages is that they both illustrate the dangers of investing in companies that are not profitable. AOL Time Warner and eToys were both highly valued by investors at the time of their IPOs, but both companies ultimately failed.

He argues that shareholders should demand a normal payout of earnings, and that a low payout is often the cause of an average market price that is below fair value. He also discusses the difference between a stock dividend and a stock split, and explains why a stock dividend is preferable to a cash dividend.\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses the different types of stock dividends and their impact on shareholders. He argues that stock dividends are beneficial to shareholders because they allow them to cash in their share of the reinvested profits without having to break up their original certificate. He also points out that the usual practice of public-utility companies of paying liberal cash dividends and then taking back a good part of this money from the shareholders by selling them additional stock (through subscription rights) is inequitable because it imposes a second (personal) income tax on earnings which are not really received by the shareholders. He urges that this practice be changed by the public utilities, despite its adverse effect on the U.S. Treasury.\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses the importance of being an intelligent owner and how to do so. He argues that shareholders should be more active in monitoring the behavior of corporate managers and detecting conflicts of interest between insiders and outside investors. He also provides advice on how to judge the efficiency of management and what to do if you conclude that the managers are no good.\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses the importance of reading the proxy statement before (and after) buying a stock. He also emphasizes the need for investors to vote their proxies and to select one or more professional and independent directors. Finally, he discusses the importance of management acting in the best interests of outside investors.\n","In this chapter, Graham explains the importance of dividends and why companies should pay them. He argues that dividends are a way for companies to return money to shareholders and that they are a sign of a healthy company. He also discusses the dangers of companies hoarding cash and not paying dividends.\n","\n","In the commentary, Jason Zweig provides additional evidence to support Graham's arguments. He cites studies that show that companies that pay dividends outperform those that do not, and he also provides examples of companies that have lost money by not paying dividends.

He defines margin of safety as “the excess of the value of an asset over its cost” and argues that it is essential for protecting investors from losses.\n","\n","Graham applies the concept of margin of safety to both bonds and stocks. In the case of bonds, he argues that the margin of safety is the difference between the bond’s yield and the current interest rate. For stocks, he argues that the margin of safety is the difference between the stock’s price and its intrinsic value.\n","\n","Graham concludes the chapter by arguing that the margin of safety is the most important factor to consider when making an investment decision. He writes, “The margin of safety is the only reliable safeguard against the major risks of investment.”\n","In this chapter, Graham introduces the concept of margin of safety, which he considers to be the central concept of investment. He defines margin of safety as the difference between the price paid for an investment and its intrinsic value.\n","He argues that the margin of safety is essential for protecting investors from losses, and that it is particularly important in times of market volatility.\n","He also discusses the difference between investing in growth stocks and investing in value stocks, and how the margin of safety applies to both strategies.\n","Finally, he provides several examples of undervalued or bargain securities that offer a margin of safety to investors.\n","Chapter 10: Margin of Safety as the Central Concept of Investment\n","\n","- The margin of safety is the difference between the purchase price of an investment and its intrinsic value.\n","- A true margin of safety can be demonstrated by figures, persuasive reasoning, and reference to a body of actual experience.\n","- Conventional investments are appropriate for the typical portfolio and include U.S. government issues, high-grade, dividend-paying common stocks, state and municipal bonds, and first-quality corporate bonds.\n","- Unconventional investments are those that are suitable only for the enterprising investor and include undervalued common stocks of secondary companies, medium-grade corporate bonds and preferred stocks when they are selling at such depressed prices as to be obtainable also at a considerable discount from their apparent value.\n","In this chapter, Graham introduces the concept of “margin of safety” as the central concept of investment. He argues that a sufficiently low price can turn a security of mediocre quality into a sound investment opportunity, provided that the buyer is informed and experienced and that he practices adequate diversification.\n","\n","He then goes on to give several examples of what he considers to be sound investment opportunities, including real-estate bonds, “special situations,” and common-stock option warrants. He concludes by saying that investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike, and that investors should follow the same principles that they would use in running their own businesses.\n","The first rule of investing is to not lose money. This means not taking on too much risk and not paying too much for a stock. Even if you make some money, it will take you a long time to recover if you lose a lot of money in the beginning. To keep Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, from darting away, you must be patient and disciplined in your investing.\n","In this chapter, the author discusses the importance of margin of safety in investing. He uses the example of Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, to illustrate the concept. Lakshmi is often depicted with her feet bound or nailed to the floor, which symbolizes the importance of keeping her wealth in place. Similarly, the intelligent investor should use a margin of safety to protect their wealth from unnecessary risk.\n","\n","The author then discusses the difference between risk and uncertainty. He argues that risk is something that can be quantified and managed, while uncertainty is not. He uses the example of JDS Uniphase Corp., a fiber-optics company that went from a market value of $143 billion to $2.47 per share in just two years. This shows that even companies with strong fundamentals can be subject to sudden and unpredictable changes in value.\n","\n","The author concludes by discussing the importance of understanding your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. He argues that investors should not rely on their willpower alone to prevent them from panicking during market downturns. Instead, they should use strategies such as diversification, dollar-cost averaging, and investment contracts to control their own behavior.\n","In this chapter, Graham discusses the importance of diversification and avoiding overconfidence. He uses the example of Pascal's wager to illustrate how the consequences of being wrong can be far greater than the probability of being right. He concludes by sharing the story of two partners who achieved success by following a conservative investment strategy.\n","In this chapter, Graham shares an anecdote about a successful investment decision he made. He and his partner bought a half-interest in a small insurance company called GEICO. The company did very well and the value of their shares increased exponentially. This anecdote illustrates that one lucky break can be more profitable than a lifetime of careful investing. However, Graham also emphasizes that such opportunities are rare and that investors should always diversify their portfolios to protect against risk.\n","The article discusses the effectiveness of the Graham and Dodd value investing approach. The author presents a group of investors who have beaten the S&P 500 index year after year and argues that they do so by applying the principles of value investing. The author also discusses the efficient market hypothesis and argues that it is not supported by the evidence.\n","The text is about the investment philosophy of the author, who is a disciple of Benjamin Graham. The author argues that a disproportionate number of successful investors in the investment world came from a small intellectual village that could be called Graham-and-Doddsville. The common intellectual theme of the investors from Graham-and-Doddsville is that they search for discrepancies between the value of a business and the price of small pieces of that business in the market. They exploit those discrepancies without the efficient market theorist's concern as to whether the stocks are bought on Monday or Thursday, or whether it is January or July. The author then presents the results of three investors who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation from 1954 to 1956. The first example is that of Walter Schloss, who never went to college, but took a course from Ben Graham at night at the New York Institute of Finance. Walter left Graham-Newman in 1955 and achieved the record shown here over 28 years.\n","The text describes the investment strategies of several successful investors, including Warren Buffett, Tom Knapp, Bill Ruane, Charlie Munger, and Rick Guerin.\n","\n","- Buffett's strategy is to buy undervalued stocks and hold them for the long term. He does not worry about market fluctuations or short-term performance.\n","- Knapp's strategy is similar to Buffett's, but he is more diversified and occasionally buys control of businesses.\n","- Ruane's strategy is to buy large companies that are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value. He has been able to achieve strong performance even when the market is down.\n","- Munger's strategy is to focus on a few stocks and hold them for the long term. He is willing to accept greater volatility in exchange for higher returns.\n","- Guerin's strategy is to buy stocks that are trading at a deep discount to their intrinsic value. He has achieved exceptional returns over the long term.\n","\n","The text also discusses the importance of having a margin of safety in investing. This means buying stocks that are trading at a significant discount to their intrinsic value. This can help to protect investors from losses in the event of a market downturn.\n","This chapter presents the records of 9 investors who follow the value investing approach. The author selected these investors based on their investment philosophy and temperament. He argues that this group of investors has assumed far less risk than average and has successfully exploited gaps between price and value. He also discusses the difference between risk and reward and provides an example of how a value investor can profit from a declining stock price.\n","The article discusses the value investing approach and how it has been practiced by Walter J. Schloss for over 35 years. Schloss's approach is based on the principles laid out in Benjamin Graham and David Dodd's book Security Analysis. Schloss believes that there are wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace, and that those who read Graham & Dodd will continue to prosper.\n","\n","Tables 1-9 show the performance of Schloss's partnership and limited partnerships over the years.\n","The tables show the performance of three investment funds over time.\n","\n","- Tweedy, Browne Inc.: 153⁄4-year annual compounded rate of 20.0%.\n","- Buffett Partnership, Ltd.: Cumulative or compounded annual rate of 23.8%.\n","- Sequoia Fund, Inc.: Compound annual return of 17.2%.\n","\n","The tables also show the performance of the S&P 500 index over the same time period. The S&P 500 index had a 7.0% annual compounded rate of return over the 153⁄4-year period.\n","\n","These tables show that the three investment funds outperformed the S&P 500 index over the long term.\n","None\n","The first table shows the performance of Perlmeter Investments over time. The overall partnership has seen a 23% annual compound rate of return, while limited partners have seen a 19% annual compound rate of return. This compares favorably to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has seen a 7% annual compound rate of return over the same period.\n","\n","The second table shows the performance of the Washington Post Company Master Trust over time. The trust has seen a 3.9% annual compound rate of return, which is higher than the 2.2% annual compound rate of return for the A.C. Becker universe. The trust has also outperformed the S&P 500, which has seen a 10.8% annual compound rate of return over the same period.\n","\n","The third table shows the performance of the FMC Corporation Pension Fund over time. The fund has seen a 17.1% annual compound rate of return, which is higher than the 12.6% annual compound rate of return for the Becker large plan median. The fund has also outperformed the S&P 500, which has seen a 10.8% annual compound rate of return over the same period.\n","None\n","The text is about the new speculation in common stocks. The author argues that the older, well-established distinctions between investment and speculation have been obliterated. He also discusses the endogenous and exogenous speculative elements in common stocks. Finally, he uses IBM as an example to illustrate the development through time of the importance of long-term prospects for investments.\n","In the first page, Graham shares a personal experience about how he was once persuaded by an experienced investor not to buy a stock because it had no book value. However, Graham later realized that the stock had actually been growing rapidly and was a good investment.\n","In the second page, Graham discusses how the old-time investment viewpoint has changed over time. He argues that today, investors are more willing to pay high prices for stocks based on their future earning potential, even if they have little or no book value.\n","He uses the example of IBM to illustrate this point. In 1915, IBM had a book value of $130 and was selling for $130. However, by 1926, IBM had a book value of $31 and was selling for $59. This shows that investors were willing to pay a much higher price for IBM based on its future earning potential.\n","In the third page, Graham discusses how the three M's (Mystery, Manipulation, and thin Margins) used to fuel speculative fires on Wall Street. However, he argues that these factors have largely disappeared, and have been replaced by new speculative factors created by security analysts.\n","He uses the example of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (MMM) to illustrate this point. MMM is a well-managed company with a strong track record of earnings growth. However, the stock is currently trading at a very high price-to-earnings ratio. This shows that investors are willing to pay a high price for MMM based on its future earning potential, even though it has little or no book value.\n","Graham concludes by arguing that the more important the intangible factors (such as future earning potential) are in the valuation of a stock, the more speculative the stock becomes.\n","In the first page, Graham shares a personal experience about how he was once persuaded by an experienced investor not to buy a stock because it had no book value.
